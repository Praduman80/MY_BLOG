				<h2>Why I can't motivate myself ?</h2>
				<p class="posted"> Posted on may 16, 2021</p>
				<p>Let the words of your mouth and the meditations of your heart be acceptable to Me at all times. It is better to be still and say nothing than to open your mouth and allow unguided words to pass your lips which you may regret as soon as they are spoken. To be outspoken may cause unnecessary pain and suffering; therefore learn to control your tongue, and count up to ten before you open your mouth. It takes a mere fleeting second to say something hurtful, but it takes a long time to heal that hurt. When you learn to do everything to Me and to My honour and glory, you will not go wrong. If you will only take time and be very patient, you will see the divine spark deep within everyone. Then you will be able to fan that spark and never try to extinguish it by your criticism, intolerance and lack of understanding. You will know that all souls are equal in My sight.</p>

				<h2>I'm Lazy coder</h2>
				<p class="posted">Posted on may 16, 2021</p>
				<p>Life is a beautiful journey that is meant to be embraced to the fullest every day. However, that doesn’t mean you always wake up ready to seize the day, and sometimes need a reminder that life is a great gift. Whether a funny quote from a famous celebrity or an encouraging message about giving it your best from a successful business person, we can all use a little motivation and inspiration these days via a life.Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.” — PRADUMAN.
